## Information Service Engineering Research Group at FIZ Karlsruhe and KIT (AIFB)

In order to develop and provide new information services, the research department Information Service Engineering investigates models and methods for efficient semantic indexing, aggregation, linking, and retrieval of comprehensive heterogeneous and distributed data sources. To this end, both statistic and linguistic analysis methods (Natural Language Processing) as well as machine learning in combination with symbolic logic and interference mechanisms are applied.

## Projects

### Information Service Engineering MOOC at [openHPI](https://open.hpi.de/)

In today's world, access to and availability of information are almost unlimited. As a result, we need search engines and intelligent programs to process these vast amounts of data. It is crucial to achieve ever more precise, more complete, and more reliable results when searching for and linking knowledge. This is achieved, for example, by systems that detect and correct errors. In this course, Prof. Sack and his colleague, Dr. Maria Koutraki will introduce methods that enable the transition from raw data to well-structured knowledge. ”We will demonstrate how natural language texts can be analyzed using statistical models and machine learning, and how this information can be described with the help of formal knowledge representation.” Prof. Sack explains. He will also show how automated image and video analysis function, how handwritten messages are translated into machine-readable language, and how computers programs are able to read printed texts.

This course addresses students of computer science, data and web scientists, and anyone who is interested in the combination of semantic search and machine learning.

- The course starts on April 16, 2018
- Course duration: 6 weeks plus two weeks for the final examination
